Movie Recommendation System - Project Description
Overview
The Movie Recommendation System is a web-based application built using Python and the Streamlit library, designed to suggest movies similar to a given movie. It leverages machine learning techniques to analyze movie similarities based on content-based filtering. The project is developed using PyCharm and Jupyter Notebook for code development and experimentation.

Technologies Used
Python – The core programming language for the project
Streamlit – Used to build an interactive and user-friendly web application
Pandas, NumPy – Used for data manipulation and analysis
Scikit-learn – Used for similarity calculations (e.g., cosine similarity)
Requests – Fetches movie posters from TMDb API
Pickle – Stores and loads the preprocessed data for quick access
PyCharm & Jupyter Notebook – Used for coding, testing, and model experimentation
